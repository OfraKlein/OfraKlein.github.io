I am a Ph.D Researcher at the department of Social and Political Sciences at the European University Institute. My work at the EUI focusses on the far-right and social media. My further research interests include internet memes, hate speech and (computational) research methods.

I previously studied Sociology at VU University Amsterdam, Political Science at Leiden University and Digital Humanities at KU Leuven.  I previously worked as a research assistant at the Department of Sociology at VU University Amsterdam and at the Berkman Klein Center.
